## Inteligencia Artificial II

Enunciado:
Desarrollar una red neuronal que realice un proceso de clasificación de imágenes (íconos) que representan diferentes categorías.


### Introduction
    The following project is developed in Jupyter Python + TenserFlow and we call it the Keras api where we load folders containing images, thus obtaining optimal solutions for learning our neural network.

### KERAS
Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.


## Objective
 
 ■ Determine which are the best parameters in order to obtain the most suitable alternative for the neural 
   network and activation function.

 ■ Implement the resources learned in class to carry out the training of a neural network.

 ■ Apply the use of Deep Learning tools for the development of the project

 ■ Create files where the process results are generate


## Development Process

### Requirements:
1. Python 3 ... with which we will make a Notebook Jupyter
2. A suite like Anaconda is recommended to facilitate the process
3. Keras and TensorFlow
4. Dataset


```KERAS
We import the necessary libraries

# Libraries

import os, sys, re, keras, seaborn
from os import remove
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as pp
from PIL import Image, ImageSequence, ImageFont, ImageDraw, ImageOps
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,accuracy_score
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from keras.models import Sequential,Input,Model
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten, Conv1D, GlobalMaxPooling1D,MaxPooling1D,GlobalAveragePooling1D

from tensorflow.python.keras import backend as K
from tensorflow.python.keras import optimizers
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
%matplotlib inline
K.clear_session()

## We read our main directory
icons = np.load('Icons-50.npy', allow_pickle = True).item()

### We divide our dataset in training and test applying the train_test_split method
train_X,test_X,train_Y,test_Y = train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.2)

# 1. Implemented methods to load the images

For the processing of the images, a data set is available that contains images
What we do is divide the data set into 80-20 for training and testing.

Before we start we must load the data we need and use the ** plt.imread (filepath) 
** method that will load all the images in an array.

### Conclusion
Well ending, keras is a very powerful library that help us in many ways when creating a neural network, provides us with several classes to create, but despite this is very important to make a cleanup of the data before performing the analysis, because there may be empty data, for example we should apply the average for the data or the kmeans algorithm.

• Keras provides a high-level API for creating a deep neural network.
• Keras allows you to define a trigger function of your choice on each layer.
• Image recognition was carried out, with different layers and with good precision. RNA options were presented, with the best result being a precision of (PENDIENTE CUANTO MARCO EL RESULTADO) 83,   this is due to the activation function, the layers and times used.
• The combination of different trigger functions, the number of layers and the optimizer used will cause the precision result to vary considerably.

### Recomendation
• When working with images, it must be clear if they are in color or not, and they flatten the dimension for a better effect on the result.
• The amount of data must be significant, since RNA may not be as accurate with little data.
